## Ingredients:

- 500 grams, gram flour (besan)
- 1 tsp, ova (carom) crushed
- 1½ tsp, jeera (cumin seeds) powder
- 1½ tsp, red chilly powder
- 1 pinch, asafoetida
- ½ tea cup, oil (hot)
- salt, as per required
- water, as per required for kneading dough
- oil, to deep fry

*Equipment for karakaddi maker: (Stainless Steel Kitchen Press Grater); similar to chakli maker but with narrow sieve*


## Method

Take the above ingredients in the bowl, add hot oil and mix well with the spoon, and then with your hand till the oil is mixed well with the flour. Now add the water little by little and make a soft dough, cover the dough with wet cloth and keep aside for 10 mins.

To check if the oil is hot before frying, put a tiny piece of dough in the oil. If it rises, this means the oil is hot and it is ready to fry in. 

Apply the water or oil on the inside of the karakaddi maker before putting the dough in it. Then put a handful of dough in it. Before pressing the dough to make karaddies, keep the oil on medium flame. Press on the maker and make karakaddi direct in the kadai (shallow pan) filled with oil. This is done by moving the maker along the sides of the pan in a circular motion to match the shape shown in the photo. (Unlike chaklis, these cannot be first made on butter paper).

Fry the karaddis on both the sides by turning them from time to time and till it turns light brown. Another sign would be that there will be much less bubbling in the oil. Once done, remove on the kitchen paper to absorb any excess oil. Let the karaddies cool for at least 4 to 5 hrs and then put them in an airtight container.
