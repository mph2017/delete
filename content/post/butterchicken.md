Now in the same pan, add oil and butter. Add the sliced onions and saute till the onions are light brown in colour. Add the chopped ginger, garlic, cashew nuts and chopped tomatoes; saute. Add salt and keep on low flame so that onion and tomatoes turn soft.
With the flame still low, add Kashmir red chilly powder, cumin powder, garam masala, malt vinegar and sugar. Saute this mixure. Add the coconut milk and ½ a cup of water. Cover the dish and continue to cook on low flame till the onions and tomatoes are soft and the liquid has reduced to about half its quantity. Rest this to cool and grind to paste.

**Tempering the sauce**

Take another pan, add butter and full spices (cloves, bay leaves and cinnamon sticks). When you start to get an aroma of the spices, add the ground paste and saute. Add the fried chicken pieces and again saute this. After this, add 3/4 cup cream from 1 cup. (Keep the remaining cream for garnishing). Give the sauce a boil and cook till the chicken is done. Finally, add the crushed fenugreek leaves and mix well.
