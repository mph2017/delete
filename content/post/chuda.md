Chuda
<!--more-->

### Ingredients:

* 1 kg, thick poha (beaten rice)
* 1/2 kg, peanuts, whole with skin
* 1/4 kg, raisins
* 1/2 dry coconut
* 1/4 kg, masala chana dal
* 1 tsp, red chilli powder
* 1/2 tsp, turmeric powder
* 1 cup, castor sugar
* salt, as per taste
* oil, for deep frying

### For seasoning

* 2 tbsp, oil
* 8-10, green chillies, chopped roughly
*1 bunch, curry leave

## Method:

In a deep pan, add the 2 tablespoons of oil. When warm, add the curry leaves, green chillies and saute for 1 min and keep aside to cool.

Separately, take a kadai (wok) and place a strainer in it. Add oil enough for deep frying the poha in batches. To check if the oil is hot, put 1 teaspoon of poha in the oil. When it rises up immediately this means the oil is ready for frying.Â Now put 2 handful portions of poha in the strainer and let to fry until it rises and is fluffy. This typically takes a few seconds - remove it immediately and put on the kitchen paper towel or brown paper to drain the oil. Repeat this till all the poha is fried.

In the same way, fry each of the following ingredients i.e. peanuts, raisins and dry coconut pieces separately and put on the paper. Keep changing the paper towels till the oil dries. Now mix everything along with the red chilli powder, turmeric powder, salt, castor sugar and the seasoning. Ensure that everything is mixed nicely. Spread well on the paper and let to cool for at least 3 hours. Store the chuda in an airtight container or box.

*Optional:* you can deep fry and add corn chips to the above chuda.
