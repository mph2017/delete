*Broil* two tablespoons of masoor dal. You can do this by placing them on a pan on high heat and stirring them from time to time. Do this for about 2-3 minutes. Take care not to burn the lentils.

*Grinding:* Take a blender and add the onions, tomato, 3 garlic cloves, black pepper corns, red chilly powder, cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric, broiled masoor dal, a can of coconut milk, yoghurt, green chillies and **vonti solan**. Blend all the ingredients to a paste.
Wash and cut the cabbage into cubes and keep aside. Next, take a pan and add oil. 

When the oil is hot,  add mustard seeds, cumin seeds, fennal seeds, curry leaves, and remaining crushed garlic. When the garlic is brown, add the ground paste, saute and add salt. Also add required amount of water according to the consistency of curry you would like.

Give the curry a good boil and check that the seasoning is as required. Separate the cabbage leaves in the curry. Boil again for another 2 mins and put off the flame. Serve curry with rice.
