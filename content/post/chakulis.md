## Ingredients


- 200 grams, rice flour
- 50 grams, maida (white wheat flour)
- 100 grams, yoghurt
- 1 tsp, teel (white sesame seeds)
- 1 tsp, cumin seeds, crushed
- Â½ tsp, turmeric powder
- 2 tsp, red chilly powder
- 1 pinch, asafoetida
- 2 tbsp, ghee (dalda)
- 2 tsp, salt
- water, for kneading the dough
- oil, for deep frying

*Equipment required: chakli maker (Stainless Steel Kitchen Press Grater)*

## Method

Take a bowl and put all the ingredients above (except the oil) and make a dough. Ensure, to add water little by little to make a soft dough. Be careful not to make this dough too hard or soft. We need the consistency to be similar to that of a soft chapatti/puri dough. Let this dough rest for 10 mins.

Now apply oil or water to the inside to the chakli maker and put handful of dough in it, cover with the top and press. Chaklis are classically spiral shaped (as shown in the photograph) and need to be made as such on the butter paper.

Keep the oil in the kadai (shallow pan) for deep frying. To check if the oil is hot put a tiny piece of dough in the oil and if it rises up immediately this means the oil is hot. Now keep the flame on medium for the next step.

Put the chaklis in the oil one by one (until you partially fill the pan) and fry them both the sides by turning them time to time for 6 to 7 mins. Fry till the chaklis are slightly brown in colour and remove them on the kitchen paper towel to absorb any excess oil. Let them cool for 3 to 4 hrs and then put them in an airtight container or bottle to prevent them turning soft and not crispy.
