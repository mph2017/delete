## Ingredients

#### Pork Bafat (Dukra maas)


* 1kg, pork cubes, with fat and bones
* 6, onions, medium-sized, fine cubes
* 3, tomatoes, large, fine cubes
* 1”, ginger, finely chopped
* 5 pods, garlic, cut finely lengthwise
* 5, green chillies, slit in half

**Whole spices**

* 3, bay leaves
* 8, cloves
* 4, cinnamon sticks (1” wide)
* 15, black pepper corns
* 1 tsp, turmeric powder
* 3 tsp, kashmiri (or other) chilli powder
* 2 tsp, bafat powder
* 2 tsp, coriander powder
* 1 tsp, cumin powder
* 1 tsp, garam masala (whole spice powder)
* 2 tbsp, tamarind water
* 2 tbsp, vinegar
* 2 tbsp, oil
* 2 cups, water (more if more curry desired)
* Salt as per taste

*Method:*

Take a large sauce pan you will be cooking the pork in. Add all the ingredients (cut vegetables as well as powders, except water) and mix. The best way to do this is with your hand, crushing the onions and tomatoes as you go. When mixed well check for the salt content. If require add little more. 

Now add the washed and drained pork cubes and mix well, again with your hand, and add the water. Keep on a high flame to cook, checking to see that the meat is cooked and stirring cautiously every 10 minutes or so. The meat should be cooked in about 40 minutes. 
You know the meat is cooked when it is no longer translucent or chewy. Boiling it over can also make it chewy. If in doubt, reduce the heat for the last 20 minutes and/or switch the flame off and cover the utensil so that the meat cooks in the steam of its curry.

**Tip #1** If you have used pork with fat, do not add oil.
**Tip #2** Pork bafat is best served with sannas or rice cakes.
